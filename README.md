# Emoji-Deleter-From-Files-Name
When I transfer files from my computer to my phone, sometimes the transformation stop and windows just can't detecte my phone and it's crash, 
that's happened repeatedly, then I notice when ever there is emoji in the file name it will crash. 
So, I just made a program that change any files name has an emoji into it.
